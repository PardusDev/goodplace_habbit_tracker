# Goodplace Habbit Tracker

This project was developed for Milu's intern training program called Grow Together. In this app, you can track your habits. The Kartal package was used to keep the app consistent, and the Provider package was used for state management. Firebase was used for user registration and database tasks. In some cases, APIs were used, and the Dio package was used for API tasks.
